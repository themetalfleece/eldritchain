# Why 97 Creatures?

## Optimized Distribution

- **Common (IDs 0-59)**: 60 creatures @ 70%
- **Rare (IDs 1000-1019)**: 20 creatures @ 25%
- **Epic (IDs 2000-2011)**: 12 creatures @ 4.5%
- **Deity (IDs 3000-3004)**: 5 creatures @ 0.5%

**Total: 97 creatures**

## ID Namespaces (Proportional!)

Each rarity has a **proportional namespace**:

- Common: 0-999 (1000 IDs) - Most variety needed
- Rare: 1000-1499 (500 IDs) - Medium variety
- Epic: 1500-1599 (100 IDs) - Limited but expandable
- Deity: 1600-1649 (50 IDs) - Small, exclusive

**Why proportional?** Namespace sizes match expected creature variety per tier!

## Why This Works

With 100 daily summons (~3 months of play):

- Common: 70 summons ÷ 60 creatures = **117% coverage** ✅
- Rare: 25 summons ÷ 20 creatures = **125% coverage** ✅
- Epic: 4.5 summons ÷ 12 creatures = **37.5% coverage** ✅
- Deity: 0.5 summons ÷ 5 creatures = **10% coverage** ✅

**Players can actually complete sets!** This keeps engagement high.
