# Eldritchain Indexer

Backend service that indexes blockchain events and provides a high-performance leaderboard API using Fastify.

## Features

- üîç **Event Indexer** - Listens to `CreatureSummoned` events
- üìä **Leaderboard** - Ranks users by deity ‚Üí epic ‚Üí rare ‚Üí common counts
- üóÑÔ∏è **MongoDB** - Stores individual summon events
- ‚ö° **Fastify API** - High-performance REST API
- üê≥ **Docker** - Easy MongoDB setup
- üìú **Event Sourcing** - Complete summon history with idempotent processing

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 22.14.0 (specified in `.nvmrc`)
- Yarn package manager
- MongoDB (via Docker or external service)

## Quick Start

### 1. Install Node.js Version

```bash
# Use the exact Node.js version
nvm install
nvm use
```

### 2. Start MongoDB

```bash
cd apps/indexer
docker compose up -d
```

This starts MongoDB on port 27017.

### 3. Install Dependencies

```bash
yarn install
```

### 4. Configure Environment

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit `.env` with your contract address and configuration:

```env
CONTRACT_ADDRESS=0xYourContractAddress
NETWORK=polygonAmoy

# IMPORTANT: Set START_BLOCK to your contract deployment block
# This avoids scanning millions of empty blocks
START_BLOCK=12345678  # Replace with your deployment block number
```

**üí° Pro Tip:** Always set `START_BLOCK` to your contract's deployment block! This avoids scanning millions of empty blocks.

**How to find your deployment block:**

1. Go to your contract on the block explorer (e.g., https://amoy.polygonscan.com/address/0xYourAddress)
2. Click on the contract creation transaction
3. Note the block number
4. Set `START_BLOCK=<that_block_number>` in your `.env`

**üõ°Ô∏è Race Condition Protection:**

The indexer includes built-in protection against race conditions:

- **Finalized Block Processing**: Only processes blocks that are finalized (crypto-economically secure)
- **Sequential Processing**: Uses a continuous loop instead of timers to ensure operations complete before starting new ones
- **Atomic State Updates**: Uses MongoDB transactions for atomic state changes
- **Duplicate Prevention**: Handles multiple indexer instances gracefully
- **Critical Error Detection**: Detects major network issues and stops processing for manual intervention
- **Retry Logic**: Exponential backoff for failed operations (up to 3 retries)
- **Graceful Shutdown**: Proper signal handling for clean termination
- **Network-Aware Finality**: Uses native network finality mechanisms with safe block fallback

**Examples:**

```env
# If deployed at block 77678611 on mainnet
START_BLOCK=77678611

# If deployed at block 5000000 on Polygon Amoy
START_BLOCK=5000000

# For Coolify or other managed MongoDB, use authSource=admin for root user
MONGODB_URI=mongodb://root:PASSWORD@HOST:27017/eldritchain?authSource=admin&directConnection=true
```

### 5. Run the Indexer

You can run both services together or separately:

**Option A: Run Both Together (Monolithic)**

```bash
# Development (with hot reload)
yarn dev

# Production
yarn build
yarn start
```

**Option B: Run Separately (Recommended for Production)**

This allows you to scale each service independently and restart them without affecting each other.

```bash
# Development - Terminal 1: API Server
yarn dev:api

# Development - Terminal 2: Event Indexer
yarn dev:indexer

# Production - Process 1: API Server
yarn build
yarn start:api

# Production - Process 2: Event Indexer
yarn build
yarn start:indexer
```

**üí° Why separate processes?**

- Scale API and indexer independently
- Restart indexer without affecting API
- Better resource allocation
- Easier debugging and monitoring

**üîí Finalized Block Processing**

The indexer uses **finalized blocks** instead of confirmation depth:

- **Finalized**: Blocks that are crypto-economically secure and cannot be reorganized
- **Safe**: Blocks that are safe from reorgs under honest majority assumptions
- **Network-aware**: Uses each network's native finality mechanisms
- **Automatic fallback**: Falls back to safe blocks if finalized blocks aren't supported

**Benefits over confirmation blocks:**
- ‚úÖ Uses native network finality (more accurate)
- ‚úÖ Adapts to different networks automatically
- ‚úÖ No manual configuration needed
- ‚úÖ More reliable than hardcoded confirmation counts
- ‚úÖ Supports all EVM networks with finality
- ‚úÖ **No complex reorg handling** - finalized blocks are immutable by design

## Docker Deployment üê≥

### Build Docker Images

From the **repository root**, build the images:

```bash
# Build API image
docker build -f apps/indexer/Dockerfile.api -t eldritchain-api:latest .

# Build Indexer image
docker build -f apps/indexer/Dockerfile.indexer -t eldritchain-indexer:latest .
```

### Run with Docker Compose

Create a `docker-compose.prod.yml`:

```yaml
version: "3.8"

services:
  mongodb:
    image: mongo:7
    container_name: eldritchain-mongodb
    restart: unless-stopped
    environment:
      MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_USERNAME: admin
      MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_PASSWORD: your_secure_password
    volumes:
      - mongodb_data:/data/db
    ports:
      - "27017:27017"

  api:
    image: eldritchain-api:latest
    container_name: eldritchain-api
    restart: unless-stopped
    depends_on:
      - mongodb
    environment:
      CONTRACT_ADDRESS: "0xYourContractAddress"
      NETWORK: "polygonAmoy"
      START_BLOCK: "12345678"
      MONGODB_URI: "mongodb://admin:your_secure_password@mongodb:27017/eldritchain?authSource=admin"
      PORT: "3001"
    ports:
      - "3001:3001"

  indexer:
    image: eldritchain-indexer:latest
    container_name: eldritchain-indexer
    restart: unless-stopped
    depends_on:
      - mongodb
    environment:
      CONTRACT_ADDRESS: "0xYourContractAddress"
      NETWORK: "polygonAmoy"
      START_BLOCK: "12345678"
      MONGODB_URI: "mongodb://admin:your_secure_password@mongodb:27017/eldritchain?authSource=admin"

volumes:
  mongodb_data:
```

Start all services:

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d
```

### Using Pre-built Images

If pushing to Docker Hub:

```bash
# Tag images
docker tag eldritchain-api:latest your-username/eldritchain-api:latest
docker tag eldritchain-indexer:latest your-username/eldritchain-indexer:latest

# Push to Docker Hub
docker push your-username/eldritchain-api:latest
docker push your-username/eldritchain-indexer:latest

# Update docker-compose.prod.yml to use your images
# image: your-username/eldritchain-api:latest
# image: your-username/eldritchain-indexer:latest
```

### Docker Image Details

**Both images use:**

- Node.js 22.14.0 Alpine (small footprint)
- Multi-stage builds (optimized size)
- Production dependencies only
- Non-root user for security

**Image sizes:**

- API: ~150MB
- Indexer: ~150MB

    {
      "address": "0x1234...",
      "creatureId": 1601,
      "rarity": "deity",
      "level": 1,
      "timestamp": "2024-10-14T12:00:00.000Z",
      "blockNumber": "12345678",
      "transactionHash": "0xabc..."
    }
  ],
  "pagination": {
    "total": 150,

    "topDeityCollector": {
      "address": "0x1234...",
      "deityCount": 15
    }
  }
}
```

## How It Works

1. **Sequential Processing**: Uses a continuous loop for sequential block processing (no overlapping operations)
2. **Finalized Block Detection**: Polls for finalized blocks using network-native finality mechanisms
3. **Event Listening**: Fetches `CreatureSummoned` events from finalized block ranges
4. **Data Processing**: Categorizes creatures by rarity (deity/epic/rare/common)
5. **Database Storage**: Stores each summon event as a separate document in MongoDB with atomic transactions
6. **Critical Error Detection**: Detects major network issues and halts processing for manual intervention
7. **Real-time Aggregation**: API aggregates stats on-demand from events
8. **Idempotency**: Duplicate events are automatically skipped using transaction hash

### Data Model

Each summon is stored as an individual event:

```typescript
{
  address: "0x1234...",
  creatureId: 1601,
  rarity: "deity",
  level: 1,
  timestamp: Date,
  blockNumber: "12345678",
  transactionHash: "0xabc..."
}
```

**Benefits:**

- Complete summon history per user
- Time-series analytics capabilities
- Easy to rebuild aggregations
- Idempotent event processing

## Leaderboard Ranking

Users are ranked by:

1. **Deity count** (highest priority)
2. **Epic count** (if deity count is tied)
3. **Rare count** (if epic count is tied)
4. **Common count** (if rare count is tied)

## Configuration

Environment variables in `.env` (all REQUIRED):

| Variable           | Description                                          | Example                                        |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `MONGODB_URI`      | MongoDB connection string                            | `mongodb://localhost:27017/eldritchain`        |
| `CONTRACT_ADDRESS` | Smart contract address                               | `0x1234...` (42 chars starting with 0x)        |
| `NETWORK`          | Network name (auto-configures RPC and chain ID)      | `polygonAmoy`, `polygon`, `sepolia`, `mainnet` |
| `PORT`             | API server port                                      | `3001`                                         |
| `START_BLOCK`      | Block to start indexing from (use deployment block!) | `77678611` or `0`                              |
| `POLL_INTERVAL`    | Polling interval in ms                               | `12000` (12 seconds)                           |

**‚ö†Ô∏è All variables are required!** The app will fail to start with a clear error message if any are missing.

**Network configuration** is shared with the web app via `@eldritchain/common`. Setting `NETWORK=polygonAmoy` automatically configures the correct RPC URL and chain ID.

## Development

### View MongoDB Data

**Option 1: Command Line**

```bash
docker exec -it eldritchain-mongodb mongosh eldritchain
```

**Option 2: MongoDB Compass (Recommended)**

- Download [MongoDB Compass](https://www.mongodb.com/products/compass)
- Connect to `mongodb://localhost:27017/eldritchain`
- Visual interface for browsing data

### Stop MongoDB

```bash
docker compose down
```

### Reset Database

```bash
docker compose down -v  # Deletes all data
docker compose up -d
```

## Production Deployment

1. Use managed MongoDB (MongoDB Atlas, AWS DocumentDB)
2. Set `MONGODB_URI` to production database
3. Use a reliable RPC provider (Alchemy, Infura)
4. Deploy to cloud (Railway, Render, AWS, etc.)
5. Enable monitoring and logging

## Troubleshooting

**"Cannot connect to MongoDB"**

- Ensure Docker is running
- Run `docker compose up -d`
- Check `docker compose ps`

**"No events found"**

- Verify `CONTRACT_ADDRESS` is correct
- Check contract has been deployed and has summon events
- Ensure `NETWORK` is correct and accessible
- Check `START_BLOCK` - if set too high, you might be starting after all events

**"Events are delayed"**

- Adjust `POLL_INTERVAL` (lower = faster, but more RPC calls)
- Use WebSocket RPC for real-time updates
- The indexer uses sequential processing - each batch must complete before the next starts
- Events are delayed by network finality time (typically 2-15 minutes depending on network)

**"Missing events" or "Race condition issues"**

- The indexer has built-in race condition protection using finalized blocks
- Ensure only one indexer instance is processing each block range
- Monitor logs for "üö® CRITICAL" messages (indicates major network issues requiring manual intervention)
- Verify MongoDB connectivity and transaction support
- Check if the network supports finalized blocks (fallback to safe blocks if needed)

**"Duplicate events"**

- Multiple indexer instances detected
- Check if multiple processes are running the same indexer
- Each indexer instance should use a different database or coordination mechanism
- The system handles duplicates gracefully but logs warnings

**"Indexer seems slow or not processing"**

- The indexer uses sequential processing - each operation completes before the next starts
- Check logs for "‚è∏Ô∏è No new blocks to process" messages (this is normal when caught up)
- Monitor "üì¶ Processing blocks" messages to see actual progress
- Large block ranges may take time due to RPC calls and database operations
- Use `MAX_BLOCKS_PER_POLL` to adjust batch size (default: 50 blocks per batch)
- Finalized block processing adds natural delay based on network finality (2-15 minutes)

**"Finalized block fallback warning"**

- If you see "‚ö†Ô∏è Finalized block not supported, using safe block as fallback" this is normal
- Some testnets or older networks don't support finalized blocks
- The indexer automatically falls back to safe blocks, which is still reorg-resistant

**"üö® CRITICAL: Finalized block went backwards"**

- This indicates a major network issue or potential data corruption
- Finalized blocks should never go backwards under normal circumstances
- The indexer will **stop processing** and require manual intervention
- **Action required**: Check network status, verify RPC provider, and restart indexer after resolving the issue
- Contact your RPC provider if this happens frequently
- This is extremely rare and usually indicates network-level problems
